* Author: **[Vadim Zaytsev](http://grammarware.github.io)** aka @[grammarware](https://github.com/grammarware)
* Title: **Defining, Composing and Managing Flexible Linguistic Commitments in Rascal**
* Abstract: Beside strict linguistic commitments of models to metamodels,
documents to schemata, programs to grammars and activities to
protocols, we often require or crave more flexible commitments to
extensions, restrictions and revisions of the original intended
language. While the corresponding FlexMDE paper (“[Taxonomy of Flexible
Linguistic Commitments](http://grammarware.net/writes/#Flexible2015)”) introduces many definitions and positions
them against one another, in this demo session will walk down a simple
example of a language (and ADT) that gets violated in various subtle
ways by functions dealing with it — yet with a possibility of
creating safe compositions of such flexibly committed functions. The
base metaprogramming language for this demo will be [Rascal](http://www.rascal-mpl.org); if you
want to run the demo on your own machine, please install the
corresponding Eclipse plugin and clone this repo.
